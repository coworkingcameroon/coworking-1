<p>Our location is pretty epic, with lots of activity around Parliament, but more than anything the people are pretty awesome. We're not afraid to claim that we've got one of the best real coworking communities in this city.</p>

<p>We're friends with a shared mission to make our work and lives better, day by day. Amongst us are tech startups, designers, entrepreneurs, journalists, academics, creatives and more â€“ we house a variety of teams and individuals.</p>

<p>Our atmosphere is friendly yet productive. It's ok to make calls, customary to put in your head phones and get shit done, but also break for a coffee or lunch with members. We also have weekly opportunities to socialise a bit. </p>
