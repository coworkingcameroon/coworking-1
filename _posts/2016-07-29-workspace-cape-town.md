<p>Workspace.CapeTown is centrally located, allowing you to work in the city centre close to all facilities, being able to make use of public transport or come in by bike. The interior is amazing, it's not like an office, it's a space where you enjoy being, making work fun!</p>
<p>It's a beautiful light office space, with plants, natural elements, and rounded shapes. It's designed around people - for them to feel good at work. The office is mostly quiet and friendly.</p>
