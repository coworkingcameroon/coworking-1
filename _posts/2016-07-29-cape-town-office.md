<p>Our space is open to all, from professional students to small companies looking for a more social environment and everyone in between. </p>

<p>Very friendly atmosphere with ambient music and free arcade games in the common area to help coworkers get through their day. The work stations allow for more quiet and focused work to be done, but there is always a healthy buzz around.</p>

<p>The members, around 70 of them now that stay part of the tribe via our Digital Networking Platform! We have an Ashtanga Yoga Shala right next door, a Swimming pool open to members on the 6th Floor looking on to Table Mountain, a huge Art & Stationary Shop downstairs which is next door to a Vida-e Coffee Shop - All in the building!</p>
