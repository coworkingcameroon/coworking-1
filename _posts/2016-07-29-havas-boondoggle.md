<p>We start of quiet on Monday but by Friday it is a hive of activity</p>
<p>We have an outdoor braai spot, a shebeen and camping on the attic. I recommend to check it out yourself. Travail is centrally and conveniently located in the Melrose Arch precinct with access to 2 hotels, 100 shops, 20 restaurants and a vibrant nightlife. There is a gym and functional fitness in the building, restaurant on site, very open and Green living building, allowing for a very pleasant and healthy environment.</p>
