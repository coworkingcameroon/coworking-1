It's a very friendly, interactive environment. Cellphones are most definitely allowed. We have our cafe lounge/ seating area, as well as a large balcony and garden area. We also have meeting rooms and boardrooms. We have a venue hire option, +- 50 people people. We have 2-3 meeting rooms (4-6 seater) and 1-2 large boardrooms (18 seater) per branch.
