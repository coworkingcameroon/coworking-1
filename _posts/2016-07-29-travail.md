Travail is an evolution of the serviced office - not just offices - workspaces designed around your modern work requirements. Travail gives the transient workforce acces to a business lounge, a cafe, meeting rooms, boardrooms, hot desks and serviced offices. At Travail you can engage, work undisturbed and be productive - contemplate, collaborate, innovate and socialize on your terms
